# titanium-studio AUR package

This is an [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/) [AUR](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/AUR_User_Guidelines)
package for Appcelerators [Titanium Studio](http://www.appcelerator.com/platform/titanium-studio/).

It provides x86 and x64 versions.

Unfortunatey because the source files themselves from Appcelerator no longer contain the 
particular version this ends up failing when an update is released. One possible way around
it would be to save the particular files to another URL though some users may not like the idea
of downloading the tarballs from elsewhere but direct from Appcelerator.
